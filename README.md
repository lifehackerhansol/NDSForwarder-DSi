# NDSForwarder for hiyaCFW
A basic nds-bootstrap forwarder generator for DSi SDNAND.

## Features
- Generate forwarders directly on the SD card.

- Delete system titles and others hidden from Data Management.

- Backup and restore installed titles.

- View basic title header info.

## Notes
- Backup your SD card! Nothing bad should happen, but this is an early release so who knows.

- This will install *everything* as a forwarder, even DSiWare. If you want to install DSiWare natively, please use [Title Manager for hiyaCFW](https://github.com/JeffRulz/TMFH).

- This is only for DSi systems. Not 3DS or DS.
