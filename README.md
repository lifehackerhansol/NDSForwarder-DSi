# NDSForwarder for hiyaCFW
A basic nds-bootstrap forwarder generator for DSi SDNAND.

## Features
- Generate forwarders directly on the SD card (games, old NDS homebrew, etc)
- View basic title header info.

## Usage
- https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/ds-index/forwarders.html?tab=tab-dsi-sd-card

## Notes
- Backup your SD card! Nothing bad should happen, but this is an early release so who knows.
- This will install *everything* as a forwarder, even DSiWare. If you want to install DSiWare natively, please use [Title Manager for hiyaCFW](https://github.com/JeffRulz/TMFH).
- This is only for DSi systems. Not 3DS or DS.
